# S3150-8T2F-FS.com-Research
Used to track progress on research with against the S3150-8T2F model of switch from FS.com.

The aim of this research was to identify security based issues within a range of switches manufactured by 'FS.COM Innovation LTD'. After working with several of the vendors enterprise level switches a number of quirks were noted within the web GUI administrative interface, CLI and firmware packaging that warranted further inspection under research conditions.
The vendor has a reputation for providing white labelled networking hardware, often at rates below that of comparable hardware from larger well know competitor brands.
The rationale for the research was to provide security based assurances on the use of the vendor's devices within corporate environments by conducting a series of targeted research projects that focused on the following areas of interest:

* Raw Firmware
* CLI administration interface
* Web based administrative GUI

The target device used for this initial piece of research was a model from the vendors entry level range: S3150-8T2F
